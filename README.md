This is a header file that can be used when dealing with very large numbers. It currently supports multiplication, division and adding.
Return values of all functions are strings so keep that in mind. For now it doesn't really safeguard all edge cases but I plan to add that
in the future, as well as making it behave like a true BigInteger library.
